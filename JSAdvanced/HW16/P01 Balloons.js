/* 
You have been tasked to create several classes for balloons.
Implement a class Balloon, which is initialized with a color (String) and gasWeight (Number). 
These two arguments should be public members.

Implement another class PartyBalloon,which inherits the Balloon class and is initialized with 2 additional parameters 
– ribbonColor (String) and ribbonLength (Number).

The PartyBalloon class should have a property ribbon, 
which is an object with color and length – the ones given upon initialization. 
The ribbon property should have a getter.

Implement another class BirthdayBalloon, which inherits the 
PartyBalloon class and is initialized with 1 extra parameter – text (String). 
The text should be a property, and should have a getter.
