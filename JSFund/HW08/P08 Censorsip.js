// The thought police are at it again and they need your help!
// Write a JS function that would censor news articles. 
// You will be given a text and then a list of strings that need to be blacked out from the text. 
// Replace all occurrences of the strings with dashes of the same length as the string. 
// The strings will not overlap, so order of processing is not important. 
// See the examples for more information.
//
// The input comes as two arguments â€“ one string and one array of strings. 
// The first element is the text to scan and the array contains the strings to be censored.
//
// The output is the return value of your functions. 
// Save the censored results in a string and return it.

// Input
// 'roses are red, violets are blue', [', violets are', 'red']
// Output
// roses are ---------------- blue

censorText('David Ruben Piqtoukun (born 1950) is an Inuit artist from Paulatuk, Northwest Territories. His output includes sculpture and prints; the sculptural work is innovative in its use of mixed media. His materials and imagery bring together modern and traditional Inuit stylistic elements in a personal vision. An example of this is his work "The Passage of Time" (1999), which portrays a shaman in the form of a salmon moving through a hole in a hand. While shamanic imagery is common in much of Inuit art, the hand in this work is sheet metal, not a  traditional material such as walrus ivory, caribou antler or soapstone. Ruben\'s brother, Abraham Apakark Anghik Ruben, is also a sculptor. Fellow Inuit artist Floyd Kuptana learned sculpting techniques as an apprentice to David Ruben.', ['Inuit']);
